# CV-Game-controller

Simple Game Controller with Hand Tracking
This is a simple Python script that utilizes the MediaPipe library to track hand movements and detect the number of fingers raised. You can use this code as a basic game controller or for any other interactive application that requires hand gestures.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python
OpenCV (cv2)
MediaPipe (mediapipe)


You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe

How to Use
Clone this repository or create a new Python script.
Copy and paste the code provided into your script.
Ensure that you have a webcam or camera connected to your computer.
Run the script.

Usage
The script captures video from your webcam.

It calculates the number of fingers raised for each hand and prints the result.
You can use this information to control a game or application.

Controls
To exit the script, press the 'q' key.

Customization
You can customize this script to suit your needs. For example, you can add logic to control a game character or trigger actions based on specific hand gestures.
